## 2026-10-02 — Task 69 self-update hardening integrated

- Current reviewed Runner MCP main checkpoint: `4b5351de6e03ab8938ebb799e2847e2195e8ee3a`.
- Issue #217 is COMPLETE via PR #219.
- Exact-head attribution #285 and validation #790 are green, including Ruff/pytest, built release artifact and clean five-minute demo.
- Autostart CLI tests no longer observe real systemd/cron state or the host's runtime-smoke result.
- Pre-install self-update failures now restore the clean source checkout to the starting/installed main commit before any install transaction becomes authoritative.
- A successful source rollback preserves the original bounded failure category; source rollback failure becomes `source_recovery_required`.
- If an install transaction was persisted or became unreadable, install-recovery remains authoritative and artifacts are preserved; post-install recovery behavior is unchanged.
- The remaining Runner MCP lanes are not safe autonomous code work: #108 is a private-host proof, #198 waits on replacement-host/CPU qualification, and #110/#125 depend on Fabric #479 plus live Agent-Bus proof. #101 is external/public discovery follow-up.
- Do not reactivate the unreliable i9 host or duplicate Fabric durability/live-proof work from Runner MCP.

## 2026-10-02 — Fabric live-cutover dependency reconciled

- Runner Fabric was reconciled against current main after the 0.1.3 release.
- The former #256/#264 checkpoint is obsolete: coarse work-unit service/MCP, reserved loopback runtime and durable journal substrate are integrated through Fabric #258/#266/#355/#357, with Agent-Bus work-unit bridging also present.
- Fabric issue #479 now owns the remaining live bounded work-unit qualification with GitHub credentials/network denied, including exactly-once replay/restart/fencing evidence.
- Current Fabric `AgentWorkUnitService` still keeps active request/result ownership in its in-memory `_records` map and does not consume `FilesystemWorkUnitJournal`; do not infer service-level restart durability merely because the journal substrate exists.
- Fabric #486 adds concrete source-write adapters but explicitly does not activate live work-unit execution.
- Runner MCP #110 has been updated to this checkpoint. Task 58 remains blocked on the private-host qualification plus the live Fabric proof; no duplicate Runner-MCP implementation is justified.

## 2026-10-02 — Runner MCP 0.1.3 published

- Task 68 is COMPLETE.
- Protected workflow run `36962568072` ran against exact main `0aa013c279128e22fbd53be32c35bced3ae26834`.
- Final version-metadata verification, full release check, wheel/sdist build and immutable workflow artifact all passed before publication.
- PyPI publication via OIDC passed and the workflow confirmed exact version `0.1.3` became visible before continuing.
- Official MCP Registry publication passed using the pinned publisher and GitHub OIDC.
- GitHub pre-release `v0.1.3` was created with wheel and sdist assets; the tag resolves exactly to `0aa013c279128e22fbd53be32c35bced3ae26834`, matching current main at release time.
- Do not rerun publication or move `v0.1.3`. Subsequent work starts from post-release hardening/live-proof lanes (#198, #108, #110/#125) or a new bounded task.

## 2026-10-01 — Runner MCP 0.1.3 release candidate integrated

- Current reviewed main checkpoint: `ee6ab95bec9be4d8d2f7b75854e1b2a17503da76`.
- Task 67 is COMPLETE via PR #208.
- Candidate version metadata is synchronized at `0.1.3` across `pyproject.toml`, `server.json`, `src/runner_mcp/__init__.py`, `glama.json` and the publish-workflow default.
- CHANGELOG now separates already-published 0.1.1/0.1.2 history from the current unreleased 0.1.3 delta.
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_0.1.3.md` records security-relevant changes, unchanged dependency contract, upgrade notes and known activation limits.
- Exact candidate head `6e5f7ddb28c8d9dfe1a1cabe5a7f1153a854c5f9`: attribution #265 green; Runner MCP validation #772 green; built release artifact green; Clean Ubuntu installer proof #5 green.
- The first clean-demo attempt hit an external `files.pythonhosted.org` pip read timeout. The failed job was rerun on the exact same candidate SHA and passed; no product-code workaround was introduced.
- No tag, PyPI upload, MCP Registry publication or GitHub release has been performed.
- Publication is a separate release action and must use the exact green main revision after a final release check.

## 2026-10-01 — Task 64 integrated; Fabric activation blocker narrowed

- Runner MCP current reviewed main checkpoint: `f666876ac3096fdd6663b368b2f1fe4ecbbed279`.
- Task 64 is COMPLETE via PR #202. The shared local autostart gate now requires emergency-stop/recovery/restart clear state, fresh fixed runtime smoke and `host_integrity_clear` before systemd or cron mutation.
- Direct systemd/cron installer entry points independently reject a missing/non-clear activation permit before touching unit files, systemctl or crontab.
- Exact-head PR #202 attribution #253 and validation #761 are green, including Ruff/pytest, built release artifact and clean five-minute demo.
- Stale overlapping PRs #199 and #201 are closed as superseded.
- Runner Fabric reconciliation: #357 durable journal, #355 loopback agent runtime and #383 Agent-Bus work-unit bridge are merged. However `AgentWorkUnitService` on current Fabric main still keeps work-unit ownership/result state only in its in-memory `_records` map and does not consume the durable `FilesystemWorkUnitJournal`.
- Therefore Runner MCP issue #110 remains blocked on upstream Fabric durable service/resume integration plus private-host qualification (#198); do not activate the coarse bridge yet.
- No new Runner-MCP code lane should duplicate Fabric durability work. Continue with public/documentation or live/operator work only when its prerequisites are available.

## 2026-09-30 — Tasks 50–52 reconciled

- Current reviewed main checkpoint: `0bade0af6ee574b09de42bb493f5ecffa41657d5`.
- Task 50 is COMPLETE via PR #149 / `469138077066b7b924ba867456ad44dc6372c85d`; issue #143 closed.
- Issue #151 is COMPLETE via PR #152 / `0bade0af6ee574b09de42bb493f5ecffa41657d5`; exact-head #669/#157 and post-merge #671/#159 are green; issue closed.
- Task 51 review is COMPLETE: keep service-journal output local-only. Generic redaction cannot prove arbitrary application/customer/personal data safe for remote disclosure. No remote log action is authorized.
- Task 52 review is COMPLETE: PR #150 provides a bounded Fabric bootstrap foundation, but #144 remains open because three explicit guards are still missing.
- Task 53 must add: self-update/restart/recovery exclusion; fixed installed-runtime preflight; different-installed-commit first-install conflict before subprocess.
- PR #153 refreshes unique PR #127 relay-core work; do not duplicate it. Task 54 owns integration/closure.
- PR #129 remains unique primary watcher work; Task 55 owns reconciliation after Task 54.

Immediate resume order:
1. integrate this review/coordination PR after exact-head CI;
2. implement Task 53 and close #144 only after exact-head + post-merge proof;
3. reconcile #153 and close #127 only after #153 is integrated;
4. then reconcile #129 against the new main;
5. keep remote service logs deferred.

## 2026-09-29 — Tasks 47 and 49 integrated; bounded queue refilled

- Runner MCP `main` checkpoint: `67954dea2117cce3a1819132f6d3c7480dd34c82`.
- Task 47 is COMPLETE via PR #145 / merge `67954dea2117cce3a1819132f6d3c7480dd34c82`.
  - local/private only: `runner-mcp service-log PROJECT ALIAS --lines N`;
  - per-service `allow_log_read: false` opt-in;
  - fixed no-symlink `journalctl`, fixed argv/env, 1–100 entries, <=10s, <=32 KiB retained stdout;
  - Task-41 redaction receives known local runtime secrets/private paths plus private unit/health URL;
  - disabled/unknown service fails before subprocess;
  - read remains available during emergency stop;
  - no MCP, bridge, mailbox or Agent-Bus log action exists.
  - exact-head validation #654 + attribution #140 and post-merge validation #655 + attribution #142 are green.
- Task 49 is COMPLETE via PR #124 / merge `da367081f88d6d2342cf938a9b67ec59d9d10de0`.
  - explicit additive async migration start/status exists;
  - `migration_async` approval is distinct from synchronous `migration`;
  - synchronous `apply_migrations` and deployment-triggered migrations remain unchanged;
  - exact-head validation #622 and post-merge validation #623 are green.
- Task 50 is the next small CODE lane: close the remaining issue #143 gap by preflighting installed-runtime `pip` + `setuptools.build_meta` before wheel-stage mutation.
- Task 51 is review-only: decide whether any remote service-journal disclosure is justified after Task 47; do not add remote log authority during the review.
- Task 52 is review-only: define the first-install Runner Fabric bootstrap safety boundary for issue #144 before any bootstrap mutation/tool is implemented.
- PR #127 and PR #129 remain open and contain unique Agent-Bus work. Do not duplicate or close them merely because #131/#132/#134 later merged; reconcile/rebase those PRs separately.
- Issue #130 remains open because its live activation proof is broader than the merged lifecycle code.
- Issue #143 remains open until Task 50 production preflight is integrated.
- Issue #144 remains open and high risk; Task 52 review comes first.

Immediate resume order:
1. integrate this coordination update after exact-head CI;
2. implement Task 50 as the next bounded CODE lane;
3. Task 51 and Task 52 can proceed as independent reviews if code work blocks;
4. do not duplicate PR #127/#129 Agent-Bus work;
5. keep remote service logs, generic package install, arbitrary VCS/package/shell authority and production mutation out of scope.

## 2026-09-28 — Task 44 integrated; Task 45 async migration boundary decided

- Runner MCP `main` checkpoint before this review branch: `6053b7c3d5aef757055c453d2fd5b7f581248e53`.
- Task 44 is COMPLETE via PR #118 / merge `6053b7c3d5aef757055c453d2fd5b7f581248e53`.
- Task 44 evidence is fully green: exact-head validation #607 + attribution #91 and post-merge validation #609 + attribution #94; full pytest, Registry/whitespace, release artifact and clean demo are green.
- The durable migration substrate is additive only: private strict migration-job storage, queued/running/terminal state, restart -> interrupted without replay, canonical plan revalidation, bounded public status and read-only `MIGRATION_JOB` completion delivery. Existing synchronous `apply_migrations`, direct `migration_status`, bridge `APPLY_MIGRATIONS` and deployment-triggered migrations remain unchanged.
- Task 45 review is COMPLETE in `claude_feedback/TASK45_ASYNC_MIGRATION_INTEGRATION_REVIEW.md`.
- Task 45 decision: do not version or silently change synchronous `apply_migrations`. If async remote execution is integrated, add explicit `start_migration_job` + `migration_job_status` tools / bridge actions.
- Async execution must use a separate human approval operation `migration_async`, with a fixed async execution discriminator in the approval binding, so sync and async approvals are not interchangeable.
- Required start ordering: require configured runner -> recompute canonical migration state -> consume async approval -> durable queued persistence -> worker start. A consumed approval with no job is safer than durable execution intent without consumed approval.
- Bridge persistence/finalize ambiguity after a job starts must never replay/enqueue a second job. Immediate start result means durable acceptance/queueing, not migration completion.
- Task 49 is the bounded CODE follow-up. It must not add cancellation, automatic retry/resume, arbitrary SQL/executable/cwd, production mutation, automatic restore, generic async execution, job listing or change the current synchronous path.
- Task 47 local bounded service-journal reader remains independently prerequisite-safe.
- PR #120 package-version identity fix is separate from this review; it is being revalidated against the Task-44 main before merge.
- Issues #108/#110/#101 retain their existing external/upstream gates.

Immediate resume order:
1. integrate this Task-45 review after exact-head CI;
2. Task 49 may implement only the explicit additive async migration start/status contract;
3. Task 47 remains a separate safe local-only lane and may proceed independently;
4. preserve synchronous `apply_migrations` until/unless Task 49 is separately green and integrated;
5. do not infer completion from bridge/audit records; terminal migration completion comes only from durable migration-job metadata.

## 2026-09-28 — Tasks 48 and 43 complete; migration-job substrate next

- Runner MCP `main` is `a95e75739bb71bcbaf653244e0ebf9c9bee7b0ee`.
- Task 48 is COMPLETE via PR #115 / merge `02475b4c5aa1f103b55f9e4ca6a71e0d09892c7c`: deploy/rollback now share one fixed private release-root `fcntl.flock` boundary in addition to the existing in-process thread lock. Exact-head and post-merge validation are green.
- Task 43 is COMPLETE via PR #116 / merge `a95e75739bb71bcbaf653244e0ebf9c9bee7b0ee`: local-only `retention prune-plan` / `retention prune-release` can remove exactly one freshly eligible staging orphan release per short-lived single-use plan after fresh current/metadata/policy revalidation under the shared release lock.
- Task 43 preserves the retained rollback/reference closure and migration boundaries, never deletes backups, never adds automatic pruning, and adds no MCP/mailbox/bridge deletion authority.
- Quarantine/transaction state is private and durable; post-quarantine failure is reported as manual-attention state rather than guessed success or replay.
- Exact-head Task 43 validation #592, attribution #76, build artifact and clean demo are green; post-merge validation #593 and attribution #77 are green.
- Task 44 durable migration-job substrate is now the preferred next independent CODE lane. Its scope remains additive: persisted migration jobs + read-only completion source only; existing synchronous MCP/bridge `apply_migrations` and deployment-triggered migrations remain unchanged.
- Task 47 local bounded service-journal reader remains independently prerequisite-safe.
- Issue #108 remains externally blocked by the authorized private-host connector quota. Issue #110 remains gated on upstream Fabric durable gateway/startup readiness. Issue #101 remains externally gated for actual secondary-directory submissions/claims.

Immediate resume order:
1. integrate this coordination-only status update after exact-head CI;
2. implement Task 44 from its Task 42 review with a separate private migration-jobs root and strict restart-no-replay semantics;
3. after Task 44 integration, perform Task 45 review before any remote async migration contract change;
4. Task 47 may proceed independently if Task 44 blocks;
5. keep backup pruning, automatic pruning, restore execution and all remote deletion authority deferred.

## 2026-09-27 — Task 46 reconciled; Task 48 release-lock prerequisite queued

- Live Runner MCP `main` before this coordination branch: `37c78fd0d2a0e2f620dc225f81e72843413ef3c3`; PR #113 discovery hardening is merged and post-merge validation #582 / attribution #66 are green.
- The previously unintegrated Task 46 review was reconciled against current `DeploymentManager`. Its core finding still holds: deploy/rollback use only per-process `threading.Lock` instances, so a future local CLI pruning process cannot safely share that mutation boundary.
- Task 46 is therefore COMPLETE as a review and its canonical deliverable is `claude_feedback/TASK46_CROSS_PROCESS_RELEASE_LOCK_REVIEW.md`.
- Task 48 is the separate prerequisite-safe CODE follow-up: add one private release-root `fcntl.flock` primitive and integrate it into deploy/rollback while preserving the existing thread lock and release -> database lock ordering.
- Task 43 local one-release pruning remains BLOCKED until Task 48 is integrated and proven. Do not implement pruning inside Task 48.
- Task 44 durable migration-job substrate and Task 47 local bounded service-journal reader remain independent prerequisite-safe CODE lanes.
- Issue #108 private-host recovery proof remains externally blocked by the authorized remote-management connector quota; do not bypass it with broader authority.
- Issue #110 Fabric bridge activation remains upstream-blocked. Latest checkpoint: Fabric #258 and #266 are merged/green; #256 and #264 remain open on failing/non-mergeable heads; #268 remains open.
- Issue #101 secondary discovery remains externally gated for actual directory submissions/claims; canonical discovery metadata is now hardened on main and the official MCP Registry publicly indexes v0.1.2.

Immediate resume order:
1. integrate this coordination-only Task 46 review after exact-head CI;
2. implement Task 48 as its own bounded code PR with multi-process/adversarial lock tests;
3. only after Task 48, reconsider Task 43 pruning;
4. Task 44 or Task 47 may proceed independently if Task 48 becomes blocked;
5. keep #108/#110/#101 external gates honest; do not convert preparation into claimed proof/publication.

## 2026-09-27 — Runner Fabric coarse bridge transport merged

- Runner MCP transport integration is merged on `main` as `3ebd39981c358c307fa66afa32ad2f5fc32731cf` via PR #111; issue #109 closed automatically as completed.
- Exact PR head `872798831403515bc6944b62efaac5992897b253` passed Runner MCP validation run #571 and commit-attribution run #54 with zero review threads.
- The PR validation checked GitHub's synthetic merge `cd60179b8d8f7c5d8895beef6164a7cb932937fe`, combining #111 with then-current `main` `776b5d0fd3499ca6ed6674806b2075167fc59f9e`; current-main compatibility was therefore validated before merge.
- Post-merge commit-attribution run #55 and Runner MCP validation run #572 are both terminal green on exact merged `main` `3ebd39981c358c307fa66afa32ad2f5fc32731cf`.
- The bridge remains optional and fail-closed: without private loopback Fabric configuration, no Fabric tools are registered and normal Runner MCP behavior is unchanged.
- When configured, the only Fabric-facing tools are `fabric_run_work_unit`, `fabric_get_work_unit` and `fabric_cancel_work_unit`; no generic GitHub, Git, shell, filesystem, provider or status-polling proxy was added.
- Additional hardening on #111 gives each calling thread an independent local MCP session and fails closed on mismatched expected revision, mismatched work-unit identity, or inconsistent status/result pairs.
- Runner Fabric remains the orchestration/control-plane owner. Runner MCP only authenticates, bounds, audits and transports the coarse request/result.
- Issue #110 remains the live activation/end-to-end follow-up. Do not duplicate the merged transport work from #109/#111.
- At this checkpoint Runner Fabric prerequisites are not ready for live activation: #258 and #266 still have failing Foundation CI, #266 is not mergeable, and #268 remains open. Reconcile upstream live state before acting.

Immediate resume order:
1. confirm post-merge Runner MCP validation #572 is terminal green;
2. keep #110 blocked until the required Runner Fabric work-unit service/MCP/startup lanes are green, integrated and privately deployable;
3. once upstream is ready, configure only the private loopback bridge and prove one bounded end-to-end coarse work-unit without exposing infrastructure details;
4. benchmark the coarse handoff against the former many-call GitHub workflow without weakening existing Runner MCP approval, operator-stop or fault-containment boundaries;
5. independent open lanes remain #108 (private-host self-update recovery proof) and #101 (external discovery/authenticated submissions); do not use either to bypass their human/private-environment gates.

## 2026-09-27 — v0.1.2 published; discovery phase active

- Canonical release is now `v0.1.2` on exact commit `83175f439c60346f92b5759a90993c3b8f5352f8`.
- Publish run #2 succeeded end-to-end: PyPI `aifordable-runner-mcp==0.1.2` -> official MCP Registry `io.github.Blacksp1d3r/runner-mcp` 0.1.2 -> GitHub pre-release v0.1.2.
- The failed 0.1.1 Registry attempt was recovered by PR #103; do not reopen the lowercase Registry identity or attempt to mutate immutable PyPI 0.1.1.
- Current focus is discoverability/distribution with no runtime-authority changes: first-party links/metadata, then Glama, Smithery, mcp.so and selected developer directories.
- External directory writes that require a separate account/OAuth/browser remain human-controlled. Do not replace them with paid submission shortcuts or spammy bulk-directory tooling.

## 2026-09-26 — v0.1.1 ready for human publication gate

- PR #102 is merged; exact merge commit `d948945034e07616d673945467e9b2e44748fa10` passed post-merge validation and attribution.
- Final package identity: `aifordable-runner-mcp`; normal command remains `runner-mcp`; the package-name alias exists for `uvx`/MCP Registry launch.
- PyPI Trusted Publisher and GitHub `pypi` environment are configured with exact environment binding and no API token.
- Do not create another distribution-fix branch. The next action is the explicit human workflow dispatch/approval for 0.1.1, followed by public verification of all three publication stages.

## 2026-09-26 — PyPI pending publisher ready; package-name fix active

- Pending Trusted Publisher is configured for `aifordable-runner-mcp` with GitHub owner `Blacksp1d3r`, repository `runner-mcp`, workflow `publish.yml`, environment `pypi`.
- `runner-mcp` was rejected by PyPI as too similar to an existing project; do not retry or bypass that protection.
- Active fix branch: `release/v0.1.1-aifordable-pypi`.
- Product/CLI remain Runner MCP / `runner-mcp`; only the PyPI distribution identifier changes to `aifordable-runner-mcp`.
- The previous umbrella brand is retired from current project materials; AIfordable is the current umbrella identity.
- Next gate: exact-head CI and review on this branch -> merge -> exact-main green -> manually dispatch `Publish Runner MCP` 0.1.1 and approve the `pypi` environment deployment.

## 2026-09-26 — distribution/discovery handoff

- Runner MCP remains released at public `v0.1.0`; `v0.1.1` is being prepared on `release/v0.1.1-discovery`.
- The slice adds PyPI/MCP Registry metadata, tokenless OIDC publishing automation, metadata consistency tests and stronger first-screen/launch copy.
- Runtime/security authority is unchanged: authenticated Streamable HTTP, local private setup and deny-by-default capability boundaries remain intact.
- Do not publish 0.1.1 until branch CI is exact-head green, the change is integrated to `main`, and the one-time PyPI Trusted Publisher + GitHub `pypi` environment setup is complete.
- After those gates, run the human-triggered `Publish Runner MCP` workflow with version `0.1.1`; it publishes PyPI first, then the official MCP Registry, then creates the GitHub pre-release.
- After Registry publication is verified, proceed to secondary MCP directories and community launch posts using `docs/LAUNCH_COPY.md`.
## 2026-09-24 — v0.1.0 published; next session starts post-release

- Runner-MCP `v0.1.0` is now a published GitHub pre-release from exact validated commit `f00ac3fd03df234cb186a4dfcd804136501c0cf7`.
- PR #98 reconciled README, CHANGELOG and launch-readiness after publication and merged as `5647aa8839af90451189d2d943ce393edfacfe78`; exact-head run #514 and merged-main run #515 are fully green.
- Do not retag or move `v0.1.0`. Post-release `main` being ahead of the release tag is expected.
- First next actions: reconcile live GitHub; confirm no new blockers; verify a clean-host install from the published tag; set the prepared repository description/topics if still missing.
- Keep Task 10 private-host self-update/recovery proof as an explicit alpha limitation until actually proven.
- Runner Fabric stays separate and must not be pulled into Runner-MCP scope.

## 2026-09-24 — RELEASE-CANDIDATE RECONCILIATION CHECKPOINT

- Runner Fabric is a separate private project/repository. Keep this repository focused on Runner-MCP release work only.
- PR #97 is merged as `9ce5fe94f417e4e7f910c9945727f70cffd33ecb`; exact PR head `91e0c1b1e737ad14a43b31750cfdfbf1bf582f24` passed run `36037258558` fully green.
- Live reconciliation after the merge shows no open Runner-MCP PRs and no open Runner-MCP issues.
- Task 41 is integrated. Task 47 is now prerequisite-safe. Task 43 remains blocked on Task 46 cross-process release-mutation locking. Task 44 is prerequisite-safe; Task 45 remains blocked on Task 44.
- None of Tasks 43–47 is automatically a blocker for the first tagged alpha; the public release gate remains exact-green candidate + accurate documented limitations.
- Task 10 private-host self-update/recovery proof is still unproven. Do not claim it in release notes; preserve the limitation unless it is safely proven later.
- After this coordination commit, require exact-main green CI before any tag/release decision.
- No tag, GitHub release, package publication, repository-setting mutation, registry submission or external announcement has been performed.

# Runner MCP — Session Handoff

Last reconciled: 2026-09-24.

## Latest checkpoint — Task 34 PR #92

- PR #91 merged to main as `11b9a4d4e508ac93cd436037563c09d08cfa43ab`; Tasks 33, 35 and 38 are complete and must not be duplicated.
- Task 34 is COMPLETE on PR #92 pending final exact-head CI/integration.
- Task 34 adds only local read-only `runner-mcp retention preview PROJECT`; no pruning/deletion, approval, MCP or mailbox authority was added.
- Retention preview is fail-closed on unsafe release/backup storage and reports advisory categories only. Manual backups remain non-eligible without a dedicated retention policy.
- Actual pruning remains deferred.
- Task 37 review is independently active on PR #93; Task 39 adapter refactor is now prerequisite-safe.
- Task 10 private-host self-update/recovery proof remains externally BLOCKED; no tag/release/publication is authorized.
- Reconcile live GitHub before any next claim; exact-head CI is authoritative.

## Current checkpoint
- Live GitHub reconciled through Tasks 32 and 36 merge plus final coordination; live GitHub always wins over this recorded checkpoint.
- Tasks 21–32 and Task 36 are COMPLETE and must not be duplicated.
- Task 31 local read-only PostgreSQL restore preflight is implemented; restore execution, restore approvals, WAL/PITR, production recovery and MCP/bridge/mailbox restore authority remain deferred.
- Task 32 COMPLETE: PR #89 merged as `e629515f9c7e7a5d44506dfb82a48343870f94da`; exact head `99c72037eff4ed54cf7e92f7a08b278b48af4e45`; CI 35967246877 fully green with Ruff, whitespace, 1267 tests, built artifact and clean demo.
- Task 36 COMPLETE: PR #90 merged as `8c971016e4fc3cd821dc52d28334567c20835ff4`; exact head `1b3567b5de1f5a4ac5a67db16c609db2edac25dd`; CI 35967550375 fully green with Ruff, whitespace, 1267 tests, built artifact and clean demo.
- The six demonstrated alpha-release documentation drifts are reconciled. `0.1.0` remains explicitly unreleased; no `v0.1.0` tag or GitHub release exists at the audited checkpoint.
- Repository description/topics, v0.1.0 tag/GitHub release, package/registry/ecosystem publication and external community posts remain explicit user-controlled actions.
- Task 10 remains BLOCKED on usable private-host self-update/recovery proof. Public alpha wording must not imply that private-host live proof exists.
- Current bounded public queue: Task 33 optional graphical administration boundary review; Task 34 local read-only retention preview; Task 35 manual historical rollback selection boundary review.
- No new task is claimed at this checkpoint. Reconcile live GitHub plus `claude_feedback/CURRENT_ASSIGNMENT.md` before the next claim.
- No tag, GitHub release, package publication, deployment, rollback, migration, restore, deletion, network exposure change, repository-setting mutation or external publication has been authorized/performed in this session.
- Desktop Commander remains unavailable due the previously reached monthly limit; private-host proof remains unresolved.
- Before asking for alpha-release authorization, verify full GitHub CI is green on the exact latest `main` commit after these final coordination updates.

## Purpose
Runner MCP is a small, auditable, deny-by-default operations interface. GitHub is the code/collaboration surface; Runner MCP is the local execution and safety boundary. It must never become a generic remote shell.

## Architecture
- public project-agnostic core in this repository;
- private configuration holds real host/repository/ref/credential values;
- strict GitHub mailbox protocol for bounded remote operations;
- replay protection, safe result envelopes and restart-safe watcher coordination;
- predefined test profiles and bounded workers/queues;
- explicit operator emergency stop;
- commit-pinned self-update with staged wheels, transaction markers, activation markers and rollback/recovery controls.

## Current state
- Task 8 merged via PR #52 (`d6821ddb0773b586b6a106b66b2e18154c90cc7a`): fail-fast local release-check wrapper plus isolated clean-demo project venv.\n- Task 6 has one demonstrated docs drift queued: `runtime_doctor` is implemented but omitted from README/public bridge action documentation.\nGitHub current state wins if anything below is stale.
- `main`: `011fcbfec4e0b75a93820ca1c4c487111da6b495` at this reconciliation checkpoint.
- No open Runner-MCP pull requests at this checkpoint.
- PR #46 merged as `a50fe7eca0c74dff8aa337e431feadf55fa3e287`: installer/operator missing-sudo robustness.
- PR #47 merged as `5d2f21409723578e7b6873f31746fac1d8ada459`: secure-I/O inventory.
- PR #48 merged as `4f84a192581015e219774b8d0a40e1172124c12b`: self-update file + directory fsync durability.
- PR #49 merged as `57d9f114dcab22df434aaa051796ae036b71ebb9`: category-only safe diagnostics contract.
- PR #50 merged as `07d9a4b1041cd20e7b2201aa4a83b674a1a1c85c`: narrow REMOVE-confirmation helper.
- PR #51 merged as `011fcbfec4e0b75a93820ca1c4c487111da6b495`: current-main recovery visibility; stale PR #45 was closed unmerged.
- The last recorded private-runtime handoff said the watcher had 4 recovery-attention items and a read-only runtime probe was pending. That private state was not re-probed in this GitHub-only session and must be treated as historical until checked again.

## Important decisions
- no arbitrary shell/executable/path/environment/process/package-manager input through MCP/mailbox;
- production restore/PITR and generic transaction reset remain outside the mailbox;
- self-update targets exact lowercase commits reachable from canonical `origin/main`;
- install recovery is local operator-only and requires the emergency stop;
- GitHub live PR/issue/CI state is authoritative over stale handoff text.

## Open PRs / issues
- No open Runner-MCP pull requests at this checkpoint.
- No open Runner-MCP issues were re-established as blockers during this GitHub reconciliation.

## Blockers
- private watcher/recovery health still needs a fresh bounded probe before mailbox-driven self-update proof; the previous degraded observation is not assumed current;
- private host still needs bootstrap/proof of the newest recovery-capable self-update baseline;
- Desktop Commander is unavailable due monthly limit; prefer GitHub + bounded Runner-MCP bridge when available.

## Current assignment
1. keep Task 6 and Task 7 as normal-chat analysis/review work, not Claude Code work;
2. use ChatGPT for Task 8 implementation unless explicitly reassigned;
3. before live self-update proof, obtain a fresh bounded private-runtime watcher/recovery status;
4. bootstrap and live-prove the current recovery-capable self-update baseline only after watcher/recovery state is clean enough for safe proof.

## Next safe steps
- Task 6: documentation/CLI contract drift audit as a CHAT REVIEW; return findings only, no code.
- Task 7: dependency-set / `--no-deps` compatibility analysis as a CHAT REVIEW.
- Task 8: local release-check convenience as ChatGPT CODE work.
- independently, re-probe private watcher/recovery state before relying on mailbox-driven self-update proof;
- never reset replay/cursor/transaction state generically.

## Definition of done for a work batch
Tests/evidence must be terminal, blockers must be recorded or resolved, and this file plus `CURRENT_STATE.md` / `AGENT_EXCHANGE.md` must make the next safe action obvious.
