# Runner MCP — Dependency / Integration Order

Last reconciled: 2026-09-24. GitHub current state wins.

## Current build order
1. Core safety/protocol invariants remain the base for every later slice.
2. Task 10 private-host live self-update/recovery proof remains externally blocked; it does not block independent public hardening work.
3. Tasks 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 and 36 are complete on main; do not duplicate them.
4. Tasks 33–35 are the current bounded public queue after ownership reconciliation: optional graphical administration boundary review, local read-only retention preview, and manual historical rollback selection boundary review.
5. Task 28 depended on Task 24 and is complete via merge `131e168e02b7d5781441bbc8256e65de434e6166`. Migration completion remains blocked on a separate persisted migration-job substrate.
6. Task 29 depended on Task 25 and is complete via merge `b0f54cb14d73fba3b7c5b8655b5b051af779fd0a`.
7. Task 31 depended on Task 27 and is complete via merge `e54a0684bdc9da3a32d062e0e0e45261c1616020`. Actual restore/PITR and remote restore authority remain deferred.
8. Task 34 depends on Task 30 and that dependency is satisfied by merge `99d081cd242642bfa8346031a22079b7397869bc`. Actual pruning/deletion remains deferred.
9. Task 32 is complete via review merge `e629515f9c7e7a5d44506dfb82a48343870f94da`; it demonstrated six documentation drift blockers before any alpha tag.
10. Task 36 depended on Task 32 and is complete via merge `8c971016e4fc3cd821dc52d28334567c20835ff4`; release documentation drift is reconciled, but no tag/release/publication is authorized.
11. Task 23 had Task 18 as its prerequisite; that prerequisite is satisfied by merge `5c4f5db350cdafa99066bdb091866b7d6979a7a9`.
12. Dependency/build/interpreter contract changes still require explicit bootstrap because self-update intentionally uses `--no-deps`.
13. Public release/tagging requires explicit user authorization and an exact green candidate; private-host proof limitation must remain explicit until actually proven.

## Parallel work that is safe
- documentation/CLI contract drift audits;
- direct regression coverage;
- installer/operator UX that does not alter self-update authority;
- secure-I/O inventory/design;
- scrubbed diagnostics design.

## Integration points
- `bridge_protocol.py`, watcher/replay lifecycle and private transport must stay mutually compatible;
- `self_update.py`, `self_update_install.py`, source-control guards and local CLI recovery form one safety boundary;
- dependency-set changes require explicit bootstrap because self-update intentionally uses `--no-deps`.

## Do not parallelize blindly
Avoid overlapping edits to self-update/restart/transaction code from multiple agents. Coordinate through `handover/AGENT_EXCHANGE.md`.
