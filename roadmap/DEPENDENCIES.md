# Runner MCP — Dependency / Integration Order

Last reconciled: 2026-09-23. GitHub current state wins.

## Current build order
1. Core safety/protocol invariants remain the base for every later slice.
2. Task 10 private-host live self-update/recovery proof remains externally blocked; it does not block independent public hardening work.
3. Tasks 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31 are complete on main; do not duplicate them.
4. Tasks 32–34 are the current bounded public queue after ownership reconciliation: alpha launch-readiness gap audit, optional graphical administration boundary review, and local read-only retention preview.
5. Task 28 depended on Task 24 and is complete via merge `131e168e02b7d5781441bbc8256e65de434e6166`. Migration completion remains blocked on a separate persisted migration-job substrate.
6. Task 29 depended on Task 25 and is complete via merge `b0f54cb14d73fba3b7c5b8655b5b051af779fd0a`.
7. Task 31 depended on Task 27 and is complete via merge `e54a0684bdc9da3a32d062e0e0e45261c1616020`. Actual restore/PITR and remote restore authority remain deferred.
8. Task 34 depends on Task 30 and that dependency is satisfied by merge `99d081cd242642bfa8346031a22079b7397869bc`. Actual pruning/deletion remains deferred.
9. Task 23 had Task 18 as its prerequisite; that prerequisite is satisfied by merge `5c4f5db350cdafa99066bdb091866b7d6979a7a9`.
10. Dependency/build/interpreter contract changes still require explicit bootstrap because self-update intentionally uses `--no-deps`.
11. Public release/tagging requires explicit user authorization and an exact green candidate; private-host proof limitation must remain explicit until actually proven.

## Parallel work that is safe
- documentation/CLI contract drift audits;
- direct regression coverage;
- installer/operator UX that does not alter self-update authority;
- secure-I/O inventory/design;
- scrubbed diagnostics design.

## Integration points
- `bridge_protocol.py`, watcher/replay lifecycle and private transport must stay mutually compatible;
- `self_update.py`, `self_update_install.py`, source-control guards and local CLI recovery form one safety boundary;
- dependency-set changes require explicit bootstrap because self-update intentionally uses `--no-deps`.

## Do not parallelize blindly
Avoid overlapping edits to self-update/restart/transaction code from multiple agents. Coordinate through `handover/AGENT_EXCHANGE.md`.
