# Runner MCP roadmap

This public roadmap is intentionally infrastructure-neutral. Real deployment details belong only in private configuration.

## Phase 0 — repository and design

Establish repository structure, security baseline, threat model, configuration model, handover notes, dependency policy, and public-repository hygiene controls.

## Phase 1 — minimal MCP server

Implement Streamable HTTP, authentication, health endpoint, project registry, structured audit logging, request identification, basic rate limiting, `list_projects`, and `project_status`.

## Phase 2 — safe file access

Add allow-listed project file reads, metadata, pagination, path traversal protection, symlink escape protection, secret deny-lists, and file-size limits.

## Phase 2.5 — operator safety and rollback policy

Before enabling mutating tools:

- require an external operator emergency-stop mechanism;
- keep future operator actions read-only until retention policy is explicitly confirmed;
- retain code releases using both a minimum count and minimum age;
- retain pre-migration backups separately from code releases;
- treat database point-in-time recovery as a separate retention control;
- allow only one code rollback step per approved action;
- prohibit automatic production database restores;
- require explicit human approval before any database restore;
- require recovery/preflight metadata before migration, deploy, or rollback.

## Phase 3 — controlled test runner

Implemented design:

- predefined test profiles only;
- absolute executable paths and argument arrays with `shell=False`;
- project-relative working directories;
- bounded concurrency, timeout and log size;
- asynchronous jobs with status and paged logs;
- explicit cancellation;
- external operator-stop observation;
- process-group cleanup;
- scrubbed secrets and private paths in logs;
- persisted safe job metadata and interrupted-job recovery;
- restricted environment passthrough;
- no automatic execution of untrusted public-fork code without stronger sandboxing.

## Phase 3.5 — packaging and onboarding

Make the safe core usable without reading or editing source code:

- `runner-mcp setup` interactive private configuration;
- local/public setup modes with safe local defaults;
- explicit retention confirmation;
- `status`, `doctor` and emergency-stop commands;
- project add/list/remove commands;
- test-profile add/list/remove commands;
- pytest and Ruff profile presets;
- explicit token rotation only;
- non-root `install.sh`;
- user-first README and Quickstart;
- private config permission checks and atomic project-config updates.

Still planned for onboarding: service auto-start packaging, guided TLS/reverse-proxy setup and optional graphical administration.

## Phase 4 — staging service management

Implemented core design:

- private service aliases mapped to systemd-user units;
- no arbitrary unit names supplied by MCP clients;
- safe alias listing without unit/health-URL disclosure;
- status and optional HTTP health checks;
- independent opt-in for start, stop and restart;
- all mutating actions pass the operator safety guard;
- emergency stop leaves status available but blocks service mutations;
- subprocess execution uses a fixed systemctl argument array with `shell=False`;
- no sudo or generic system-service control.

Journal/log access remains a later bounded addition.

## Phase 5 — backups and migrations

Implemented core design:

- PostgreSQL-only database configuration with private `RUNNER_MCP_DB_*` credentials;
- DSN entered through hidden CLI prompt and kept out of project YAML;
- private backup root/project directories and 0600 dump/metadata files;
- `pg_dump` custom-format backups with DSN in child environment, never argv;
- safe backup metadata listing without dump paths or contents;
- predefined migration status/apply profiles with `shell=False`;
- bounded and scrubbed migration output;
- pre-migration backup required before migration apply;
- safety guard rechecked after backup and before migration;
- failed migration keeps the recovery point and never auto-restores;
- CLI database and migration configuration without manual YAML editing.

Not implemented yet:

- database restore;
- WAL archiving/PITR orchestration and verification;
- automated retention pruning.

## Phase 6 — staging release engine

Implemented core design:

- staging-only deployment configuration;
- clean Git HEAD as the only deploy source;
- no client-supplied branch/ref/commit or arbitrary build shell;
- fixed Git argv with hooks/fsmonitor disabled;
- safe Git archive extraction with repository symlinks rejected;
- private release root, releases directory and runtime HOME;
- required test profiles before release creation;
- source HEAD/cleanliness rechecked after tests and before migrations;
- optional Phase 5 migration orchestration;
- atomic `current` symlink activation;
- configured service restart plus mandatory health check;
- one automatic code rollback after failed activation only when no migration was applied;
- no automatic rollback after database migration;
- persisted asynchronous deployment jobs and restart-interruption handling;
- MCP `plan_deploy`, `deploy_staging`, and `deployment_status`;
- CLI deployment configuration without manual YAML editing.

Still deferred:

- production deployment;
- framework-specific build/adapters;
- release pruning;
- manual historical rollback selection (Phase 7).

## Phase 7 — rollback engine

Add release listing and controlled rollback. Database restoration remains a separately protected operation.

## Phase 8 — multi-project adapters

Move project-specific behavior behind a common adapter interface. New projects should normally require configuration/adapters rather than core changes.

## Phase 9 — approval and risk gates

Add two-step plans, short-lived approvals, environment-specific permissions, and stronger safeguards before any production capability is considered.

## Phase 10 — optional restricted command templates

Only if concrete use cases remain unmet, add tightly allow-listed executable templates under a sandboxed account. No free-form root shell.

## MVP completion

The MVP is complete when one pilot project can be inspected, tested, backed up, migrated, deployed to staging, health-checked, and rolled back without a general remote-shell dependency, while all actions remain auditable and secrets stay inaccessible.
